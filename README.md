# Ultimate Pool 100
This is a simple multi-user Java3D program. <br>
You should be able to interact with a pool table and scoreboard. <br>
It is written entirely in Java and only uses Java3D and consequently Swing. <br>
Documentation for the source code can be found [here](https://faceincake.github.io/UltimatePool100/).

## Project Structure

### src
Contains the source code of the project. <br>
Packages and classes and the like.

### test
We don't plan to make a deployment process and make any release builds. <br>
But it's always good habit to make a test folder for any Java files that test your code.

### docs
Contains the source code documentation. <br>
Here's the [Documentation](https://faceincake.github.io/UltimatePool100/).

### assets
Contains any files that are read by the program. <br>
Like images, audio, or other large data.

## Deployment

No deployment procedures or release builds are planned. <br>
Being a Java program, all you need to is run one of the file from the `main` package. <br>
This is generally slower and bulkier but cut us a break.

## Code Structure

An Agile development process gives the following priorities... <br>
1. Polymorphic classes
2. Easy implementation
3. Object Oriented
